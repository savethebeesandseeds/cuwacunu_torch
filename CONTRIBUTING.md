# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you contribute, you thereby agree not to inject malice.

## How to contribute

At this time, contributions are handled through feature requests only.
Open a GitHub Discussion describing the request or proposal.
Direct code contributions, pull requests, and code merges are not being accepted right now.

## License of contributions

By submitting a feature request or other content (ideas, docs, assets, snippets, or text), you confirm you have the right to submit it and you license it under the repository MIT license in `LICENSE`.

In short: inbound = outbound. We do not add extra restrictions beyond MIT for project contributions.

## Third-party material

Do not remove or alter existing third-party notices.
If you add a new third-party component, update `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and include its required license text when needed.
